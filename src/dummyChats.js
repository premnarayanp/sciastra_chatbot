        question: "Are the SciAstra courses worth it or not for IAT and NEST?",
        ans: "Whether or not the SciAstra courses are worth it depends on your individual needs and goals. If you are a serious student who is looking for a comprehensive and well-structured preparation program, then the SciAstra courses may be a good option for you. However, if you are on a tight budget or if you are not sure how much time you can commit to studying, then you may want to consider other options.",

        question: "Is the SciAstra course enough for the IAT and NEST preparation?",
        ans: "Definitely yes I’ve been a student at Sciastra and I am actually 2023 aspirant. So last year without Sciastra I scored just 45 marks in IAT 2022 and this year with Sciastra course I got 125 marks and AIR 2192 and in NEST I got AIR 354. Many students even secured 2 digit ranks. The material, the mentors everything is just fab. I would definitely recommend Sciastra, the quality of mock tests are too more than enough. Also there will be enough practice as in crash course we did 50 mocks in 3 months which got us acquainted with a variety of questions…. Also ques from mocks many a times get repeated in the actual exam.So overall according to my experience with Sciastra you should definitely join ",

        question: "Should I join the SciAstra Vikram batch for the IAT and NEST 2024 preparation?",
        ans: "The ans. :- In two words “you should”. In the Vikram batch u guys are going to have live classes, mock tests, doubt solving sessions, access top notch study materials and much more. The mentors are the current students from top tier colleges of the country like IISERs, NISER, IISc, IACS, IITs etc. They are very much friendly and approachable and not to mention, they work really hard to fulfill all ur needs. The mock tests are the best you can possibly get and trust me, are harder than the actual exam. They are levelled up in order to get u ready for any possible scenario that might occur in the actual exam. Apart from this, if you're a PCM or PCB student you need not worry as the mentors take the utmost care to make you understand each and every topic even if you've parted ways with the subject for over 1 or 2 yrs (trust me on this, even I am a PCM student). That's mostly it.Is SciAstra Vikram course enough to get you through IAT and NEST : In short, “no”. No course can guarantee ur selection. However, in SciAstra you're basically spoonfed so, all you need to ace the exams is consistency. It's definitely not easy but if you're consistent enough to diligently follow all instructions and complete the tasks given then you already cover a long way..Hope this helps ",
